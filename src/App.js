				- Title of team
				- Avatars of each team
				- Team points
				- Space for "XXX" when teams get answers wrong

				Middle top center: Total points of board
				
				Middle: 8 slots for answers and points

				Where to put:
					- Team 1 wins button
					- Team 2 wins button
					- Restart round button
					- Wrong answer buttons (triggers "XXX" for each team)
					- Next round button
